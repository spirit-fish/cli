## Spirit Fish: A futuristic environment for your browser-based JS apps

> Spirit Fish is a deployment and rendering environment backed by a powerful CDN. Our approach is different to Vercel or Netlify in that we leverage the power of the browser to server render any type JS of project, and cache the result at the edge. No buy in to heavy-handed frameworks or expensive build platforms necessary!
>
> Build your JS project how you like - if it works in the browser, it works with Spirit Fish. Simply create a renderer in our dashboard, push your build via our CLI, and point your domain at our records.
>
> All projects come with a generous free usage tier â€“ so [getting started](https://intercom.help/spirit-fish/en/collections/1930477-getting-started) is free.
